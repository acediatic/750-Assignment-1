# Stronger

Stronger is a simple Flutter app demonstrating the core functionality of the framework, especially with regard to its differences to [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Introduction to Flutter

As per the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev):

> Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

Flutter allows you to simultaneously develop for:

1. iOS
2. Android
3. Windows
4. MacOS
5. Linux
6. Web

all using one shared code base. Unlike React, Flutter applications are written in the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language, instead of [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). Dart's syntax looks similar to JavaScipt and Java. Unlike vanilla Javascript however, Dart is **type-safe**.

Aaron Oertel [recreated their Java application in Dart](https://proandroiddev.com/why-flutter-will-change-mobile-development-for-the-best-c249f71fa63c?gi=1e32232228cf), reducing _179 files and 12,176 lines of code_ to only _31 files and 1,735 lines of code_.

## Flutter Basic Architecture

A Flutter application is built by nesting a series of _widgets_ together in the _widget tree_.

A _Widget_ is simply a unit of composition. That is, a widget is the basic building block of any Flutter application, similar to a React component.

### State Management

State in Flutter is primarily managed using one of three methods:

1. Stateless Widgets
2. Statefull Widgets
3. Providers

**Stateless Widgets**

Stateless widgets act in a similar manner to React components. They are used to display an element of the UI, be it a visible element, or a non-visible layout (such as the common Row, Column, or Grid widgets). They hold no state and are reset with each rerender.

**Stateful Widgets**

Stateful widgets hold their state between widgets, with the state matching the lifecycle of the particular widget. For example, the basic flutter app contains a counter widget, with buttons to increment and decrement the counter. The value of the counter is stored in state.

**Providers**

When wanting to share state between multiple widgets, we can pass information between widgets (similar to [prop drilling](https://blogs.perficient.com/2021/12/03/understanding-react-context-and-property-prop-drilling/) in React) using their constructors. However, this quickly becomes complex and cumbersome for anything more than trivial applications.

To solve this, the Provider package allows the passing of information using the producer-consumer model. Here, widgets can subscribe to a certain type of object (usually a datamodel object, like a shopping cart), which they can access from their parent. They typically watch for changes of this object, and rerender whenever they're notified that the object has changed.

**React Equivalences Summary**

The equivalences between Flutter and React state management methods are summarised below:
| Flutter State Management Method | React State Management Method |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Stateless Widgets | React Components |
| Stateful Widgets | React Components with useState hooks |
| Providers | ContextProvider |

Select a cross-platform development framework of your choice, and prepare a demo which explains the toolchain involved - including how to test your app on real mobile devices. Also include in your demo some examples and explanation of the differences between web development using React, and mobile development using your chosen framework.

**UI Components**
Flutter doesnâ€™t use native UI components. When the Flutter code is compiled on iOS for example, it is not compiled into the underlying iOS button type. Instead, this is all handled by Flutter's graphic engine, in a similar manner to Java's JVM.
